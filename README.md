# LeakyCups
How can we design home technology that’s more sustainable and improves relationships between technology, ecology, and people?

To investigat this we made a speculative smart cup that makes the ecological state of a watershed, data, and your personal water usage something you can’t ignore. 

This project aims to explore how alternative perspectives of time, such as the slow or cyclical nature of eco-logical time might open up new visions of what smart home technology could be. As domestic technology design tends to optimize for a very narrow set of users, use cases, and timelines, we wonder how these tech-nologies might better support the resilience of a broader (environmental) range of stakeholders and timescales. The primary mode of investigation for this project will the in-home deployment of a prototype Internet of Things device inspired by the hydrologic cycle. 

To imagine new futures for technology which make room for water systems or other ecologies to survive and flourish we need to explore alternatives to the traditional narratives around technology, modernity, and time (i.e., progress is linear, and innovation is growth). Furthermore, we need to start to better understand how care and care labor operates across these ecological timescales and better incorporate technology not just in the everyday lives of us humans but in the much longer lives of the rest of our environments if we are to better care for and with them.  

The project is part of an OpenDoTT PhD (more information at https://opendott.org) at Northumbria University, School of Design and with Mozilla Foundation as a Mozilla Fellow (https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/fellowships-and-awards-directory/). This project receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508.
